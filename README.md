# context-aware-output-filters
Exploratory experiments on human-in-the-loop verification as a lightweight fallback for low-risk AI systems, examining when partial human review can replace full automated verification without unacceptable accuracy loss.
# Context-Aware Output Filters

Notes and small experiments exploring how AI outputs can be evaluated
through **cultural**, **social**, and **contextual** lenses rather than
purely technical metrics.

## Motivation

Many AI failures are not technical failures.

They are:
- Context failures
- Cultural mismatches
- Tone and implication errors
- Assumptions embedded in training data

This repository explores how outputs might be screened or reviewed
for contextual appropriateness before use.

## Focus Areas

- Non-Western cultural contexts
- Community-oriented value systems
- Implicit assumptions in language
- Output evaluation beyond correctness

## What This Is Not

- Not a content moderation system
- Not a moral authority
- Not a censorship tool

This work is exploratory and descriptive, not prescriptive.

## Why This Matters

As AI systems are deployed globally,
context blindness becomes a real operational risk.

Understanding this dimension early enables:
- Better product design
- Fewer cultural failures
- More inclusive systems

## Status

Conceptual exploration and early notes.
